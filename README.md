# Intermediate-Coding-Projects
Projects for the Intermediate Coding Class
This Readme file will act as a sort of running list of projects and teams you can hop on.

# Current Options
Due to the semester shift, I am allowing you to select a new project to work on.
Some of you have expressed your desire to work alone, or work on independent projects.  Please see the section labeled **Independent Projects** below for more information on the requirements for the rest of the semester.
Some of you would like to still collaborate.  In that case, you will be placed with students working on one of the two Covid apps listed in the repository section.  Make this selection today and **reach out to your classmates and prof** for help.

# Independent Projects
For those of you looking to work independently, I'd like you to start by creating a **Note-Taking Application** in the IDE of your choice (Xcode or Android Studio).
## Note-Taking Application
The minimum viable product for this:
- Create an app that allows the user to edit a block of text
- The user should be able to save the block of text
- The user should be able to close the application completely and reopen it to the same block of text
Stretch goals:
- The user should be able to have multiple notes saved in a list format they can select and edit and save to.
- The user should be able to insert images to their notes
*This should be completed by April 16th*
