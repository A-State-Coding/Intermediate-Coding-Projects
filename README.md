# Intermediate-Coding-Projects
Projects for the Intermediate Coding Class
This Readme file will act as a sort of running list of projects and teams you can hop on.

# Current Options
Due to the semester shift, I am allowing you to select a new project to work on.
Some of you have expressed your desire to work alone, or work on independent projects.  Please see the section labeled **Independent Projects** below for more information on the requirements for the rest of the semester.
Some of you would like to still collaborate.  In that case, you will be placed with students working on one of the two Covid apps listed in the repository section.  Make this selection today and **reach out to your classmates and prof** for help.
